# Role of a Function Invoker

TODO



## Relationship to Function
An invoker is a piece of executable code that is responsible for a single function. How that function is located (*e.g.* location of its binary, name of the function, *etc.*) is beyond this specification. Examples of means by which an invoker MAY locate a function are process arguments or environment variables.
